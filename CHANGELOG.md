# 1.5.0

* Adding loading indicator. Thanks to Camilo Roca.
* Fixed #142 - Run all tests doesn't work when Ink Console is selected.
* Added callbacks for some Proto REPL events.

# 1.3.0

* Added def buttons to the inline saved values.

# 1.2.1

* #111 - Made small changes to error message in refresh.

  * The automatic pretty printing didn't perform as well as I would like and wouldn't correctly display values for certain Clojure types. Pretty printing through `cmd-, p` uses the Clojure REPL to pretty print the results so it's correctly displayed.
